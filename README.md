## 🌗 Advanced Light Intensity Indicator (ALII) System

The **Advanced Light Intensity Indicator (ALII)** is a fully analog circuit system designed to monitor ambient light levels and display them on a seven-segment display, ranging from 0 (lowest) to 7 (highest). Built entirely using discrete components—without microcontrollers or specialized ICs—the system combines precision sensing with time-based filtering and averaging logic to provide stable and reliable real-time outputs.

### ✨ Key Features

* **Real-Time Light Detection** using an LDR sensor
* **Output Display (0–7)** on a seven-segment interface
* **Adjustable Stability Period (30–300 seconds)** for noise rejection
* **Averaging Logic (300–900 seconds)** to compute mean light intensity
* **Fully Discrete Design**: Flip-flops, resistors, capacitors, comparators, MOSFETs
* **Energy-Efficient**: Suitable for smart lighting and environmental monitoring systems

### 🧪 Circuit Simulation

To explore and run the simulation:

1. Visit: [Falstad Circuit Simulator - ALII System](https://www.falstad.com/circuit/)
2. Click on **"File" > "Import from Text"**
3. Select the Falstad.txt
4. Click **“OK”** to load and run the simulation

> 💡 **Note:** This simulation shows logic behavior, averaging effect, and how light intensity levels are interpreted via discrete circuitry.
